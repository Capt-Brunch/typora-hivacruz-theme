# Hivacruz Theme for Typora

This is a *Work in Progress* to create a [Typora](https://typora.io) theme that matches my [iTerm2 color scheme](https://github.com/kinoute/hivacruz-itermcolors) as well as my [Sublime Text 3 theme](https://github.com/kinoute/hivacruz-sublime-theme). Heavily inspired by the [Cobalt](https://github.com/elitistsnob/typora-cobalt-theme) theme.

## Installation

1. Download the zipped project package or the [latest stable release](https://github.com/kinoute/typora-hivacruz-theme/releases).
2. Launch Typora and open `Preferences` from the app menu.
3. Go to the `Appearance` tab, and choose `Open Theme Folder`.
4. Copy the `hivacruz.css` file and `hivacruz` folder to your Typora theme library.
5. Launch or restart Typora and choose `Hivacruz` from the theme menu.

## Status

For now, as it's a *WIP*, it has only been tested on macOS Mojave 10.14.6 and some features are still missing.

The theme is usable on macOS right now with most of the features implemented but on Windows/Linux, the preferences panel might look weird and the rendering might look different.
